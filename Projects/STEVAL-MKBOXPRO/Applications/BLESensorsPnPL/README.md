## <b>BLESensorsPnPL Application Description</b>

This firmware package includes Components Device Drivers, Board Support Package and example application for the following STMicroelectronics elements:

  - STEVAL-MKBOXPRO (SensorTile.box-Pro)  evaluation board that contains the following components:
      - MEMS sensor devices: STTS22H, LPS22DF, LSM6DSV16X, LIS2DU12, LIS2MDL
	  - Dynamic NFC tag: ST25DV04K (board rev. A) - ST25DV64KC (board rev .B)
	  - On-board Bluetooth® Low Energy 5.2: BlueNRG-LP
      - Digital Microphone: MP23db01HP
 
The Example application provides one example on how send the board sensors values to the ST BLE sensor application using Bluetooth customizing the Demos using PnP-L message.
The application provided also firwmare over the air update allowing also to change the Firwmare running on the board

### <b>Hardware and Software environment</b>

- This example runs on STEVAL-MKBOXPRO (SensorTile.box-Pro) evaluation board and it can be easily tailored to any other supported device and development board.
- This example must be used with the related ST BLE Sensor Android/iOS application (Version 5.0.0 or higher) available on the Google Play or Apple App Store, in order to read the sent information by Bluetooth Low Energy protocol

### <b>How to use it?</b>

This package contains projects for 3 IDEs viz- IAR, Keil µVision 5 and Integrated Development Environment for STM32.
In order to make the  program work, you must do the following:

 - WARNING: before opening the project with any toolchain be sure your folder
   installation path is not too in-depth since the toolchain may report errors
   after building.

For IAR:

 - Open IAR toolchain (this firmware has been successfully tested with Embedded Workbench V9.20.1).
 - Open the IAR project file on EWARM directory
 - Rebuild all files and Flash the binary on STEVAL-MKBOXPRO

For Keil µVision 5:

 - Open Keil µVision 5 toolchain (this firmware has been successfully tested with MDK-ARM Professional Version: 5.38.0).
 - Open the µVision project file on MDK-ARM directory
 - Rebuild all files and Flash the binary on STEVAL-MKBOXPRO
		
For Integrated Development Environment for STM32:

 - Open STM32CubeIDE (this firmware has been successfully tested with Version 1.15.1)
 - Set the default workspace proposed by the IDE (please be sure that there are not spaces in the workspace path).
 - Press "File" -> "Import" -> "Existing Projects into Workspace"; press "Browse" in the "Select root directory" and choose the path where the STM32CubeIDE project is located (it should be STM32CubeIDE\).
 - Rebuild all files and and Flash the binary on STEVAL-MKBOXPRO
